You should read this otherwise you won't have any clue what to do :-) Version 0.1 (Written in a hurry Aug 16th, 2016)
----
1) Compile Multinest - go to Codes and execute: make all
2) You might be missing some libraries lblas, llapack ...
3) Go to Mass_Index directory and execute: make all
4) In the same directory execute: sh make.gr (this creates a code that makes triangular plots)
5) Copy executables mass_index and gr to the main directory (where mass.sh is)
----- HERE YOU ARE DONE WITH PREPARATIONS -----
6) Create your datafile: dump masses or amplitudes into a file called "datafile" - keep raw values so keep it in grams/kilograms/tons, amplitude units, the code create log10 from the datafile
7) Edit priors.in if desired (see the file for examples and some description
8) Run sh mass.sh ... after it finished you get two plots: plot.jpg (shows you the fit and residuals), pgplot.jpg (show you correlations in a triangular layout)
9) You also get gr.out where you have all 4 fitted variables (1st column) with their variance (2nd and 3rd column)

Rinse and repeat (6-9)
